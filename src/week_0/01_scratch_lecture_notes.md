# Week 0: Scratch
Computer programming is about taking some input and creating some output, thus solving problem.  
input -> â–¢ <- output

## Numeral systems
### Unary system
The simplest numeral system to represent natural numbers.
### Binary system
Computers speak only 0's and 1's in binary system.
Single bit = 0 or 1 (binary digit).

Imagine two light bulbs, one light bulb can only count from 0 to 1, where 0 = off and 1 = on.  
00 = 0 in unary and binary  
01 = 1 in unary and binary  
10 = 2 in binary / 1 in unary  
11 = 3 in binary / 2 in unary  
Number 4 needs third light bulb:  
100 = 4 in binary  
101 = 5  
110 = 6  
111 = 7  

### Decimal system
Uses 'base-10' system: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Dec = 10  
In decimal system each of the digits is in a different column.

Imagine number 123:
- '3' - Rightmost digit is the ones place or the ones column.
- '2' - The tens place or the tens column.
- '1' - The hundreds place.
123 = (100 * 1) + (10 * 2) + (1 * 3)

### Back to binary system

Binary system use 'base-2' to count:

| 2^2         | 2^1        | 2^0        |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| 4           | 2          | 1          |
| Fours place | Twos place | Ones place |

That's why in binary 100 = 4, 101 = 5, 110 = 6 and so on.  
Four number 8 you need to add one more bit 1000 = 8.  

1 byte = 8 bits  
Like this:  
00000000 = 0  
11111111 = 255  

| 2^7          | 2^6        | 2^5        | 2^4         | 2^3          | 2^2         | 2^1        | 2^0        |
|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| 8            | 7          | 6          | 5           | 4            | 3           | 2          | 1          |
| 128'th place | 64's place | 32's place | 16'th place | Eights place | Fours place | Twos place | Ones place |

Actually, there is 256 bytes, but we start at 0.
