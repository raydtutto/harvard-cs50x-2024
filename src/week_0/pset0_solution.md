# Problem set 0
The assignment is to implement in Scratch any project of your choice, be it an interactive story,
game, animation, or anything else, subject only to the following requirements:
- Your project must use at least two sprites, at least one of which must not be a cat.
- Your project must have at least three scripts total (i.e., not necessarily three per sprite).
- Your project must use at least one conditional, at least one loop, and at least one variable.
- Your project must use at least one custom block that you have made yourself (via Make a Block), which must take
at least one input.
- Your project should be more complex than most of those demonstrated in lecture (many of which, though instructive,
were quite short) but it can be less complex than [Oscartime](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/277537196) and
[Ivyâ€™s Hardest Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433).

# Solution
I made a game project as a solution.  
This is a block breaker arcade game, imitation of classic "Arkanoid".
Press spacebar to start and restart the level.

More details:
- It includes 3 levels.
- At each level the user has 5 lives.
- The ball will increase its speed with each destroyed brick.
- There are 3 types of bricks: green brick - 1 hp, orange brick - 2 hp, red brick - 3 hp.
