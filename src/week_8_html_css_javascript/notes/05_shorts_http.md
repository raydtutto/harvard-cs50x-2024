# HTTP

In addition to protocols that dictate how information is communicated from machine to machine and application
to application (IP and TCP, respectively), it is frequently the case that the application itself has a system
of rules for how to interpret the data that was sent.

HTTP is one such example of an application layer protocol, which specifically dictates the format by which
clients request web pages from a server, and the format via which servers return information to clients.

Other application layer protocols include:
- File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
- Data Distribution Service (DDS)
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Extensible Message and Presence Protocol (XMPP)

A line of the form:

| Method      | Request-target | HTTP-version |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| GET or POST |                | HTTP/1.1     |

Is a simple example of an HTTP request line, a crucial part of an overall HTTP request that
a client may make to a server.

The host name (domain name of the server) is also included as a separate line of the overall HTTP request.

Taken together, the host name and the request target from the request line specify a specific resource being sought.

Based on whether the resource exists and whether the server is empowered to deliver that resource pursuant
to the clientâ€™s request, a number of status codes can result.

A status code is part of the first line that a server will use to respond to an HTTP request:

| HTTP-version | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| HTTP/1.1     |        |
